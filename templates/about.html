          Hi there! 👋 I'm Minh Nguyen — a passionate <b>Software Engineer</b> and <b>lifelong learner</b> currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Computational Data Science. I love traveling, building web apps, exploring AI technologies, and solving real-world problems through clean and thoughtful code.
        </p>

          When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me strumming my guitar 🎸, playing soccer with friends ⚽, or digging into a good rom-com movie 🎥. I believe that creativity fuels great engineering, and I try to bring that mindset into everything I do.
        </p>

          This blog is where I share my journey ✍️ — from personal projects and technical tutorials to reflections and random thoughts. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that inspires or helps you. Feel free to reach out or connect with me!
